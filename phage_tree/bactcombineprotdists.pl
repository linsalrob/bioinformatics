# combinprotdists.pl

# modified to work with bacterial assemblies!!

# new version. This will assign a distance of $penalty to any sequence that does not match, and to all empty
# spaces. There is a good rationale for this. The The Dayhoff PAM matrix scoring system returns a percent of
# the amino acids  that are likely to have changed. Therefore a 100% score means that they have all changed.

# We will make an average, and include the number of scores used to calculate the average. Then we can fitch
# it with the subreplicas option.

# the subreplicate number will be added if the protein appears, but is not similar. (i.e. an average score of 100 2
# means that two proteins were found to be similar but were to distant for a score. But an average score of
# 100 0 means that no proteins were found!

# in this version you can select -n for no padding of missing proteins. Padding runs through the genome and if
# no match to another genome is found it increments the score by 100 for each protein in the query (line) genome
