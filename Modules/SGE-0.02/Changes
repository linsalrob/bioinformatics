v 0.01

Initial release into the wild


v 0.02 

October 2005. Received these excellent comments from Hinri Kerstens:

	Thank you for writing the ScheduleSGE perl module. When using this
	module I found two 'mismatches' between your system and mine.
	- My SGE version (5.3) returns "your job" instead of "Your job" after
	submission of a job. Maybe you can make line 233 of Run.pm tolerant for
	that.
	- The CPAN documentation claims that a jobID can be grabbed by  "my
	$pid=$sge->job_id;", but job_id doesn't exist in the modules. It should
	be "my $pid=$sge->execute;" isn't it?
	
	After these modifications the module runs happily, so keep on the good
	work.
	
	regards
	
	Hinri

These two bugs have been fixed, and the method job_id added
