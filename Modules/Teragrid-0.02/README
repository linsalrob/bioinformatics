TeraGrid::LSGW

The Life Sciences Gateway to the TeraGrid is being developed to allow biologists access to High Performance Computing. This series of modules is being developed by Rob Edwards and Ivan Judson to assist in submitting jobbs to the LSGW.

To use these modules you'll need an account on the LSGW machine with access to BLAST. You will have to contact Ivan for that.
